| 35 | HelixQA | Coder benchmark and concurrency test banks pass thirteen for thirteen against the real production model | PASS |
| 36 | HelixQA | DDoS, chaos, and memory-leak banks were re-run against the confirmed production coder, closing a prior test-target gap | PASS |

| 37b | HelixQA | A second race-condition bank targeting the HelixCode HTTP server itself remains unexecuted scaffolding | PENDING |
| 38 | Challenges submodule | New end-to-end coding Challenge proves the live coder writes and correctly executes real Python code | PASS |
| 39 | HelixCode inner module | Go race-detector sweep across nine concurrency-sensitive packages found zero races and added one new guard | PASS |
| 40 | HelixCode inner module | Two pre-existing test failures were root-caused and fixed rather than silently skipped or weakened | PASS |

| 42 | Provider evidence | A committed Google API key was discovered leaked in test evidence and now awaits operator rotation | OPERATOR-BLOCKED |

## Coverage roll-up

- **34 of 43 rows PASS** with real, on-disk captured evidence.
- **6 rows OPERATOR-BLOCKED** on a genuine external decision or credential, not a quality shortfall.
- **3 rows PENDING** honest implementation gaps (video-gen broker path, codegraph re-validate re-run, HelixCode-server race bank).
- **1 row SKIP** as an honest, documented resource-constrained deferral (StarVector GPU tier).
