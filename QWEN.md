# HelixCode - Distributed AI Development Platform

## Constitutional anchors (cascaded from `CONSTITUTION.md`)

### Article XI §11.9 — Anti-Bluff Forensic Anchor
> Verbatim user mandate: *"We had been in position that all tests do execute with success and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the completion and full usability by end users of the product!"*
>
> Operative rule: every PASS in this codebase MUST carry positive runtime evidence captured during execution. Metadata-only / configuration-only / absence-of-error / grep-based PASS without runtime evidence are critical defects regardless of how green the summary line looks. No false-success results are tolerable.

### Article XII §12.1 (CONST-042) — No-Secret-Leak
No API key, token, password, certificate, or other credential may be committed to any repository owned by HelixDevelopment or vasic-digital. All secrets live in `.env` files (mode 0600) listed in `.gitignore`. Any leak is a release blocker until rotated and post-mortemed.

### Article XII §12.2 (CONST-043) — No-Force-Push
No force push, force-with-lease push, history rewrite, branch deletion of `main`/`master`, or upstream-overwriting operation may be performed without explicit, in-conversation user approval per operation. Authorization for one push does not extend further. Bypassing hooks / signing / protected-branch rules also requires explicit approval.

### CONST-048 — Full-Automation-Coverage Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.25)
No feature/functionality/flow/use-case/edge-case/service/application on any supported platform of HelixCode is deliverable until covered by automation tests proving six invariants: anti-bluff posture, proof of working capability end-to-end, working implementation matching documented promise, no open issues/bugs, full documentation in sync, four-layer test floor. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.25 for the full mandate.

### CONST-049 — Constitution-Submodule Update Workflow Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.26)
Before any modification to `constitution/{Constitution,CLAUDE,AGENTS}.md`: fetch+pull first → apply with §11.4.17 classification → validate → commit+push to EVERY upstream → careful conflict resolution (no force-push) → cascade verification (CONST-047) → bump `.gitmodules` pointer in SAME commit. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.26 for the full mandate.

### CONST-050 — No-Fakes-Beyond-Unit-Tests + 100%-Test-Type-Coverage Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.27)
**(A)** Mocks/stubs/fakes/placeholders/TODOs/FIXMEs/"for now" patterns PERMITTED only in unit-test sources; non-unit tests MUST exercise the real, fully implemented system. Production code MUST NOT import mock paths. **(B)** 100% test-type coverage: unit + integration + E2E + full-automation + security + DDoS + scaling + chaos + stress + performance + benchmarking + UI + UX + Challenges (`./challenges/`) + helix_qa (`./helix_qa/`, with full autonomous QA sessions). See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.27 for the full mandate.

### CONST-051 — Submodules-As-Equal-Codebase + Decoupling + Dependency-Layout Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.28)
**(A)** Every owned-by-us submodule (orgs: vasic-digital, HelixDevelopment, red-elf, ATMOSphere1234321, Bear-Suite, BoatOS123456, Helix-Flow, Helix-Track, Server-Factory — dynamically discoverable via gh/glab) is an EQUAL part of HelixCode's codebase. Same engineering attention as main (analysis, tests, gap-fill, bug-fix, docs/diagrams/SQL/website materials). **(B)** Submodules MUST stay fully decoupled — NEVER inject HelixCode-specific context; use configuration injection when needed. **(C)** Dependencies of owned submodules MUST live at HelixCode root (`<root>/<name>/` or `<root>/submodules/<name>/`); nested own-org submodule chains FORBIDDEN. Third-party submodules exempt. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.28 for the full mandate.

## Project Overview

HelixCode is an enterprise-grade distributed AI development platform that enables intelligent task division, work preservation, and cross-platform development workflows. Built with Go and designed for scalability, HelixCode provides a robust foundation for distributed computing with automatic checkpointing, rollback functionality, and real-time monitoring.

The project is fully completed with 5 implementation phases:
- **Phase 1**: Foundation (Database schema, authentication, worker management)
- **Phase 2**: Core Services (Task division, LLM integration, MCP protocol)
- **Phase 3**: Workflows (Project management, development workflows)
- **Phase 4**: LLM Integration (Hardware detection, model management, CLI)
- **Phase 5**: Advanced Features (SSH worker pool, advanced LLM tooling)

Key technologies include Go 1.24+, PostgreSQL, Redis, Gin framework, and multiple LLM providers integration (Llama.cpp, Ollama, OpenAI).

## Architecture

The platform consists of:
- **API Layer**: REST + WebSocket + MCP
- **Core Services**: Authentication, worker management, task management, LLM providers
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL + Redis

### CONST-052 — Lowercase-Snake_Case-Naming Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.29)
Every directory/submodule/file MUST use lowercase snake_case names. Existing non-compliant names MUST be renamed atomically with updates to all references (configs, docs, source-code imports, governance files). Common-sense exceptions: language-mandated case (Java/Kotlin/Android/Apple/C#/Swift) inside language-root, vendor third-party submodules, build artefacts. `upstreams/` → `upstreams/` transition: `install_upstreams.sh` supports BOTH directory names during migration. Phased execution; each rename batch ships with (i) reference-resolution regression test, (ii) full CONST-050(B) test-type matrix run, (iii) anti-bluff wire-evidence. See root `CONSTITUTION.md` §CONST-052 and constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.29 for the full mandate.


## CONST-053: .gitignore + No-Versioned-Build-Artifacts Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.30)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"every project module, every Submodule, every servcie and apolication MUST HAVE proper .gitignore file! We MUST NOT git version build artifacts, cache files, tmp files, main .env file(s) or any files containing sensitive data, API keys or token! Any build derivate which we can recreate by executing proper mechanism for generating MUST NOT be versioned! We MUST pay attention what is going to be commited every time we are preparing to execute commit! If any violetion is detected it MUST be fixed before commit is executed!"*

Every project module, owned-by-us submodule, service, and application MUST ship a proper `.gitignore`. Forbidden-from-version-control classes:

1. **Build artefacts**: `/bin/`, `/build/`, `/dist/`, `/out/`, `target/`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `*.so`, `*.dylib`, `*.a`, `*.o`, `*.class`, `*.pyc`, generator-produced files when the generator is committed.
2. **Cache files**: `__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.mypy_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`, `node_modules/`, `.next/`, `.cache/`, `.gradle/`, `.terraform/`, language-server caches.
3. **Temp files**: `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `*~`, `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.orig`, `*.rej`.
4. **Sensitive-data files**: `.env`, `.env.*` (allow `.env.example` placeholder only — no real secrets even as examples), `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.crt`, `id_rsa*`, `id_ed25519*`, `.netrc`, `secrets/`, `api_keys.sh`.
5. **Generated reports/logs**: `*.log`, `coverage.out`, `htmlcov/`, runtime captures unless reference assets.
6. **OS/IDE personal state**: `.idea/`, `.history/`, `.vscode/` (except shared settings).

**Anti-bluff invariant**: `.gitignore` line alone is not sufficient — no file matching the forbidden patterns may be CURRENTLY TRACKED. A tracked `*.log` despite the ignore-line is a violation of equal severity to no ignore-line at all.

**Pre-commit attention**: every commit author (human OR agent) MUST inspect `git diff --staged` + `git status` BEFORE executing the commit. Forbidden-class hits abort the commit until fixed (un-stage, add to `.gitignore`, scrub if already-tracked). Gate `CM-GITIGNORE-PRECOMMIT-AUDIT` + paired mutation.

**Secret-leak intersection (CONST-042 / §11.4.10):** a `.env` leak is BOTH a CONST-053 and a CONST-042 violation; rotation + post-mortem required.

**Recreatable-content test**: if a documented mechanism regenerates the file from sources, it is a build derivative and MUST be ignored. The committed sources MUST include the generator.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-053` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the repository-hygiene layer. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.30 for the full mandate.


## CONST-054: Submodule-Dependency-Manifest Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.31)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"We MUST HAVE mechanism for each Submodule to determine / know what are its Submodule dependencies so new projects or palces we are incorporate them can add these Submodules to the project root and make them available! Suggested idea is configuration file with expected Submodules Git ssh urls perhaps? New project can read it, and recursively add each Submodule to the root of the project and install / expose it to veryone."*

Every owned-by-us submodule MUST ship `helix-deps.yaml` at its root declaring its own-org dependencies. Schema: `schema_version`, `deps: [{name, ssh_url, ref, why, layout: flat|grouped}]`, `transitive_handling.{recursive,conflict_resolution}`, `language_specific_subtree`. Tooling: `incorporate-submodule <ssh-url>` adds the submodule at the parent project's canonical path (CONST-051(C)), reads `helix-deps.yaml`, recurses for each declared dep, aborts on conflicting refs, emits `<root>/.helix-manifest.yaml` audit record.

Anti-bluff guarantee: every manifest paired with a Challenge that bootstraps a throwaway consuming project, runs `incorporate-submodule`, asserts produced layout matches the manifest, runs the submodule's own tests against the bootstrapped layout, captures wire evidence per §11.4.2. A manifest without this proof is a CONST-054 violation.

§11.4.31 / CONST-054 is the **operational complement** of CONST-051(C): nested own-org submodule chains are FORBIDDEN — manifests are the bridge that lets consumers reconstruct the dependency graph at the parent root.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-054` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to §11.4 PASS-bluff at the dependency-graph layer. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.31 for the full mandate.

## CONST-055: Post-Constitution-Pull Validation Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.32)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"Every time we fetch and pull new changes on constitution Submodule we MUST process the whole project and all Submodule (deep recursively) for validation and verification taht every single rule or mandatory constraint is followed and respected! If it is not, IT MUST BE!"*

Whenever a project's constitution submodule is fetched + pulled with any content change, the project MUST run `scripts/verify-all-constitution-rules.sh` BEFORE the new constitution HEAD is treated as canonical for any other work. The sweep re-runs the governance-cascade verifier AND every implementable rule gate (CONST-053 `.gitignore` audit, CONST-051(C) nested-own-org-chain audit, CONST-052 case audit, CONST-050(A) mock-from-production audit, CONST-035 anti-bluff smoke, etc.) against the post-pull tree. Failures populate the project's Issues tracker per §11.4.15 (Status: `Reopened`, Type: `Bug`); closure requires positive-evidence per §11.4.

Pull-time invocation: `git submodule update --remote constitution` triggers the sweep automatically (post-update hook OR commit-wrapper invocation). Operator-explicit manual invocation also available.

Anti-bluff: the sweep's own meta-test (paired mutation per §1.1) plants a known violation of each enforced gate and asserts the sweep reports FAIL for the planted gate. A sweep that exits PASS without running every implementable gate is a CONST-055 violation.

CONST-055 is the **enforcement engine** for every other §11.4.x and CONST-NNN rule — without it, new rules cascade as anchors but never get enforced.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-055` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to §11.4 PASS-bluff at the constitutional-enforcement layer. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.32 for the full mandate.


## CONST-056: Mandatory install_upstreams on clone/add Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.36)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"Every Submodule or Git repository we add or clone MUST BE upstreams installed using Upstreamable utility which MUST BE available through exported paths of the host system (in .bashrc or .zhrc) using install_upstreams command executed from the root of the cloned (added) repository - only if in it is Upstreams or upstreams directory present with bash script files (recipes) for all repository's upstreams!"*

Every clone / add of a Git repository under HelixCode MUST be followed by `install_upstreams` invocation from the repository's root IF its tree contains `upstreams/` (or legacy `upstreams/` per CONST-052 transition) populated with `*.sh` recipe files. The utility (installed on operator's `PATH` via `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`; implementation in the constitution submodule's `install_upstreams.sh` — already supports BOTH directory names since constitution commit `45d3678`) reads the recipe files, configures every declared upstream as a named git remote, and fans out `origin` push URLs.

Skipping the invocation when `upstreams/` is present silently breaks §2.1 (multi-upstream push is the norm) — the next push lands on only one upstream. Gate `CM-INSTALL-UPSTREAMS-ON-CLONE` + paired mutation. Automation: the future `incorporate-submodule` per CONST-054 auto-invokes; manual invocation supported. Pre-commit check: `git remote -v | grep -c push` reports expected count.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-056` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.36 for the full mandate.


## CONST-057: Type-aware Closure-Status Vocabulary (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.33)

Every project tracking work items by Type per §11.4.16 MUST close them with the Type-appropriate terminal `**Status:**` value, drawn from this 3-element closed map:

| Item `**Type:**` | Closure `**Status:**` value     |
|------------------|---------------------------------|
| `Bug`            | `Fixed (→ Fixed.md)`            |
| `Feature`        | `Implemented (→ Fixed.md)`      |
| `Task`           | `Completed (→ Fixed.md)`        |

The `(→ Fixed.md)` suffix is preserved across all three so the existing migration-discipline tooling (atomic Issues.md → Fixed.md move per §11.4.19) keeps working without per-Type branching. Generators (`generate_issues_summary.sh`, `generate_fixed_summary.sh`, the §11.4.23 colorizer) MUST treat the three terminal values as semantically equivalent (all "closed, positive evidence captured") while preserving the literal in the emitted document.

Closing a `Feature` with `Fixed (→ Fixed.md)` or a `Task` with `Implemented (→ Fixed.md)` is a CONST-057 violation. Gate `CM-CLOSURE-VOCAB-TYPE-AWARE` walks every Fixed.md heading + every Issues.md heading whose `**Status:**` is one of the three terminal values and asserts the Status-Type match. Composes with §11.4.15 / §11.4.16 / §11.4.19 / §11.4.23.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-057` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.33 for the full mandate.

## CONST-058: Reopened-Source Attribution Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.34)

Every Issues.md (or equivalent project tracker) heading whose `**Status:**` is `Reopened` MUST carry, within 8 non-blank lines of the heading, a `**Reopened-Details:**` line capturing four sub-facts:

- **By:** `AI` or `User` (source-of-truth observer who flipped the status). `AI` covers in-loop reopens (test failure, gate regression, captured-evidence retrospect). `User` covers operator-side observations (manual testing, end-user report, design reconsideration).
- **On:** ISO date (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- **Reason:** one-line cause classification — chosen from the closed vocabulary `{ test-failed | manual-testing-detected | captured-evidence-contradicts | end-user-report | cycle-re-discovered | design-reconsidered }`. Other values permitted with explicit `Reason: <free text>` annotation but the closed list MUST be tried first.
- **Evidence:** path to or short description of the captured artefact justifying the reopen — log file, recording, gate failure ID, operator quote, etc. Reopens without evidence are §11.4.6 / §11.4.7 violations (demotion from Fixed requires captured evidence under the conditions that re-exposed the defect).

The Issues_Summary.md Status column MUST distinguish the four `Reopened` sub-states by source so a sweep query for "reopens by AI in the last 30 days" is mechanically possible. Suggested column rendering: `Reopened (AI: test-failed)` vs `Reopened (User: manual-testing)`. Gate `CM-ITEM-REOPENED-DETAILS` mirrors `CM-ITEM-OPERATOR-BLOCKED-DETAILS` (§11.4.21 walk pattern). Composes with §11.4.6 / §11.4.7 / §11.4.15 / §11.4.21.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-058` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.34 for the full mandate.

## CONST-059: Canonical-Root Inheritance Clarity (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.35)

The **constitution submodule's** three files (`constitution/Constitution.md`, `constitution/CLAUDE.md`, `constitution/AGENTS.md`) ARE the **canonical root** (also called the **parent** files). They contain only universal rules per §11.4.17.

The consuming project's **repository-root files** (`<project-root>/CLAUDE.md`, `<project-root>/AGENTS.md`, optionally `<project-root>/Constitution.md`) are **consumer extensions**. They MUST start with the inheritance pointer (either the Claude-Code native `@constitution/CLAUDE.md` import or the portable `## INHERITED FROM constitution/CLAUDE.md` heading). They contain only project-specific rules per §11.4.17.

**When in doubt about which file to edit:** universal rule → constitution submodule's file; project-specific rule → consumer's file. Default consumer-side when uncertain (§11.4.17 — narrower scope is cheap to widen).

**Terminology:** "the parent CLAUDE.md" / "the root Constitution" → constitution-submodule file at `constitution/<filename>`; "the project CLAUDE.md" / "this project's AGENTS.md" → consumer-side file at `<project-root>/<filename>`.

**No silent demotion or silent promotion.** Moving a rule between layers MUST be a visible commit — `git mv` of a section if it's a clean clone, or explicit `Lifted from <project> to constitution per §11.4.35` / `Demoted from constitution to <project> per §11.4.35` commit-message annotation.

Gate `CM-CANONICAL-ROOT-CLARITY` verifies (a) consumer's `CLAUDE.md` opens with the inheritance pointer, (b) constitution submodule's three files are present at the expected path, (c) no `## INHERITED FROM` block in the constitution submodule's own files (those ARE the source-of-truth, not consumers). Composes with §11.4.17.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-059` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.35 for the full mandate.
